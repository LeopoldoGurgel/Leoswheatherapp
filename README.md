## INSTRUCTIONS

This is a single page app. You will be presented with a form in which you will write the name of the city you want to check the weather. After writing it down, either you press the submit button or press enter, the current weather will appear at the top of the page and the weather for the next five days will show right below. The name of the cities you searched will be stored in a search history at the left hand of the page.

## CREDITS

This website is powered with weather condition information provided by the Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org).

## FEATURES

To achieve the current form of the app, most of it took server side API fetch method and a lot of asyncronous functions. Promises to be more specific.
